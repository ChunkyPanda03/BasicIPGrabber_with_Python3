# A Basic IP Grabber (powered by Python3)
## Just another bordem RyanTheTide project (Windows only as of now)

Basic Webpage with IP Grabbing functionality (Webpage thanks to HTML5 UP), ensure you have the latest Python3 from the Windows Store. Run the "Logger-Install.bat" found in https://github.com/RyanTheTide/BasicIPGrabber_with_Python3/releases/latest. This will create a shotcut on your desktop labled "Start Web Logger" and open an explorer window with your project files. Feel free to edit the /Serve/index.html to personalise the site or completely delete all the web files and add your own! All logs for the application are located in /Logger/ where you will find 'http-server.log' and 'ip-requests.log', 'ip-requests.log' is where you will see the IP addresses of the devices that have connected to your website and the content that has been served to them. Note this application uses port 80 (aka http) and won't be useful without either a hostname or a dynamic-dns service (I recommend https://No-IP.com) or giving your public ip to someone to log theirs (counter-intuitive in my opinion don't you think?).
